# Horiseon Landing Page

## Purpose
In this project we were given a landing page for the company Horiseon and were told to refactor the code to include semantic html elements that are structured logically, include alt attributes for all image, and add a concise and descriptive title.

I added a title and refactored the html to include semantic elements, improving accessibility. I re-organized the directory to use github pages. I improved the css functionality by consolidating classes to avoid repeating code. I added alt attributes to the images.
